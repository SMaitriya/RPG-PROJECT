 When facing a monster, the player can use either a standard attack or their class-specific special attack that cost either mana , energy or arrows. If defeated, it’s game over. Upon victory, the player earns health and gold. The map’s shop allows the player to buy new weapons using accumulated gold. The game ends when the player either reaches the exit or is defeated by a monster.
