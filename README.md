The game starts by allowing the player to choose a name and select a class—Mage, Warrior, or Archer. Each class has unique characteristics and a special attack that consumes either energy, arrows, or mana. After choosing a class, the player can purchase a starting weapon from a list tailored to their chosen class. Once equipped, the player is placed on a map filled with monsters, obstacles, and a shop. The player can navigate the map, encountering monsters or obstacles. When facing a monster, the player can use either a standard attack or their class-specific special attack. If defeated, it’s game over. Upon victory, the player earns health and gold. The map’s shop allows the player to buy new weapons using accumulated gold. The game ends when the player either reaches the exit or is defeated by a monster.
